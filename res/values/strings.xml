    <string name="version">Happenstance Media is, as the name partly suggests, a media firm. It was created to give credence to a group of people who have a passion for stories, who would like to be storytellers and encourage ordinary people to do the same.\nFor we believe, that it is our stories that make us extraordinary. And what could be a better way to bring together different journeys onto the same platform than create an e-zine for people who would want to be the raconteurs of their own lives. Hence, Taleport (pronounced as ‘teleport’) magazine is majorly a collection of human interest stories, which will be produced on a monthly basis.</string>
